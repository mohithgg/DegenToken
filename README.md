# Sword Item Shop

In this game , there's a shop where you can win exciting sword items by redeeming it for some tokens you get in the game.

## Description

I have forked the project starter template code and I have created my own contract with the sword item shop with the following items and respective count :
- Katana(3)
- Kukhri(3)
- Cutlass(3)

  The minimum balance you need in order to redeem any item is 4500 tokens since each item costs 1500*sword ID.
  You can also mint, burn , transfer it to some other address but in the end you can wish to redeem any sword item and it will be sent :)

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Fork it from Metacrafters page
* Open it on gitpod.io

### Executing program

* On Remix IDE
  Connect your injected provider metamask and click on deploy, it gets deployed to avalanche fuji testn.et 
* Verify contract
```
npx hardhat verify <address> --network fuji
```

## Help

Getting Avalanche Fuji testnet tokens has become really hard since the introduction of coupon codes or mainnet balance to get tokens but you can use this coupon code for now - 'projectseek'
